Now that you've got a bit more comfortable with JavaScript, let's practice some filtering. In this challenge, you'll need to filter the job listings by the categories selected. There are two options to choose from for how to approach it:
- *Option 1:* Filter job listings based on the categories using the HTML data- attribute. In this option, you'd use the hardcoded content that already exists in the index.html file.
